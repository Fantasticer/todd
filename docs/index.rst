This is ToDD's documentation. Right now it's a bit empty, but check back soon! I'll be updating this heavily over the next few days and weeks.

In the meantime, check out my [blog post on ToDD](http://192.168.60.50:4000/2016/03/test-driven-network-automation/), as it's probably the best introduction to using it.
