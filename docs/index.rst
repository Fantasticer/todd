This is ToDD's documentation. Right now it's a bit empty, but check back soon! I'll be updating this heavily over the next few days and weeks.

In the meantime, check out my `blog post on ToDD <http://keepingitclassless.net/2016/03/test-driven-network-automation/>`_, as it's probably the best introduction to using ToDD for the time being.

I have also recorded some videos:
