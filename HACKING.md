- COMMENTS. Way too many open source projects have an underwhelming amount of helpful comments in the source code. When making a contribution, don't feel like you have to comment for every line, or even  at all, if the purpose of your code is obvious. We can all see the syntax, and make sense of that - comments should explain the purpose, not syntax, of your code. Bring others into your line of thinking, and why you're doing what you're doing.
- Dependencies - all contributions that introduce new dependencies - in addition to justifying the use of these dependencies, must include changes to godeps. Do more research for this.
